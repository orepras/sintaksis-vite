## File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/           # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ site-header.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ site-footer.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ book-call-button.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ HomePage.tsx   # Main home page
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils.ts       # Utility functions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ structured-data.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx            # Main app with routing
â””â”€â”€ main.tsx           # Entry point
```

The migration maintains the same visual design and core functionality while providing a simpler, more deployable structure for Cloudflare Pages.
