The session inspired me to be more mindful of my copy's journey, especially on how it will be rendered. I also found the use of JSON for documentation to be particularly interesting. It challenges the status quo but can streamline both copywriters and developers workflow by providing a simple, clear, and quick way to reference a copy. Overall, it was such a fun and thought-provoking session!",
